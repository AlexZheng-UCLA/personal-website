          I am currently a first-year master student at the Language Technologies Institute, School of Computer Science at <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong>.
Prior to CMU, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Technology from ChuKochen Honors College, <strong>Zhejiang University</strong> in China. During my undergraduate studies, I was a member of the Mixed Class of 2022 and worked with <strong>Prof. Xin Liu</strong> at UC Davis on Machine Learning Privacy. I also interned at the Big Data AI Group at <strong>Intel</strong>, as a deep learning software intern.<br/><br/>

With my experiences in machine learning and computer system, I grew interested in the intersection of these two fields. I am lucky to have to chance to work with <strong>Prof. Tianqi Chen</strong> at CMU. I am currently learning about Apache TVM, the pioneering machine learning compiler, and trying to make my own contribution.
